## Challenges üî•
When trying to implement the sign-up and login functionality using bcrypt, I ran into a lot of errors with bcrypt missing variables issues. A lot of this was partially due to the changing around of my logic for modularity so the initial code had code faults in the logic since app.js contains the bulk of the passport initialization. I eventually fix this when I realize my logic of where I was calling authentication and improper use of callbacks was the issue, so I did a double take and redid some earlier code logic.

## Installation Guide ‚öôÔ∏è

```
npm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node
npx tsc --init
