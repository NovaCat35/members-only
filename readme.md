## Challenges üî•
When implementing the sign-up and login functionality with bcrypt, I encountered numerous errors related to missing variables from bcrypt. Many of these issues stemmed from reorganizing my code for better modularity. Initially, I placed much of the passport initialization logic in the app.js file, leading to logical errors in the code. I resolved these issues by reassessing my authentication logic and addressing improper use of callbacks. This required revisiting and refining earlier sections of the codebase.

When I was satisfied with all my code, I didn't realize how convoluted and tangled up my structure for js and ts files were. When the production env started screaming at me about reading ts files and wrong paths, I finally realized my ts file all needs to be transpiled. Definitely learn that the hard way after hours monitoring error messages ~ ehe.

## Installation Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
### Development
> Type in terminal the following : 
``` 
express members-only --view=ejs
cd members-only
npm install 
npm install dotenv --save
npm install passport
npm install passport-local
npm install express-session
npm install mongoose
npm install express-async-handler
npm install express-validator
npm install node-sass-middleware <not sure if I need this anymore>
npm install express sass
npm install bcryptjs
npm install luxon (use TYPESCRIPT: npm install --save @types/luxon)
```

> Reminder to check app.js for all added changes 

### Installing TypeScript & Nodemon:
> Type in terminal the following : 
```
npm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node
npx tsc --init
npm install --save-dev ts-node nodemon
```

> 1) Adjust tsconfig.json: uncomment "outDir", "allowJs", and change "outDir": "./dist" 

> 2) Run tsc (npx tsc) to transpile your TypeScript files to JavaScript. From step 1, we will output this in "./dist"

### Production
> Type in terminal the following : 
```
npm install compression
npm install helmet
npm install express-rate-limit
```
> Reminder to change env variables(within host provider) & set node version in our package.json & NODE_ENV = "production"

> NOTE: You must build or transpile the TypeScript files for production environment. Run `npm run build`. Note any path you have to /src may need to be changed to /dist for production.
