Early planning goals: sign-up / login authentication, processing user posts and keep database session.

# Challenges üî•
When trying to implement the sign-up and login functionality using bcrypt, I ran into a lot of errors with bcrypt missing variables and 500 server issues. A lot of this was partially due to the changing around of my logic for modularity so the initial code had code faults in the logic since app.js contains the bulk of the passport initialization. I eventually fix this through trials and errors by taking a step back and reanalyzing my code logic.

## Installation Guide ‚öôÔ∏è
